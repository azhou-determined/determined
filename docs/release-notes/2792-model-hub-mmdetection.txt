**New Features**

-  Easily train object detection models using `model_hub` support for the
   [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) library. mmdetection provides efficient
   implementations of popular object detection methods like Mask-RCNN, Faster-RCNN, and DETR on par
   with Detectron2. In addition, cutting edge approaches from academia are regularly added to the
   library.
